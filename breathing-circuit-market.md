<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Breathing Circuit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open</li><li>Semi-Open</li><li>Closed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The breathing circuit market consists of three primary types: open, semi-open, and closed systems. Open circuits allow for unidirectional gas flow from the atmosphere, suitable for short procedures. Semi-open circuits also permit gas exchange but retain some exhaled gas, enhancing efficiency. Closed circuits, meanwhile, recycle exhaled gases through a carbon dioxide absorber, minimizing waste and providing optimal oxygen levels, making them ideal for longer surgeries or critical care settings. Each type serves specific clinical needs and influences anesthetic management.</p></p>
