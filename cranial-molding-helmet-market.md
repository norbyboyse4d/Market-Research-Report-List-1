<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Molding Helmet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Helmets</li><li>Passive Helmets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cranial Molding Helmet market consists of two main types: active helmets and passive helmets. Active helmets are designed with adjustable components that promote dynamic reshaping of the infant's skull, addressing conditions like positional skull deformities more effectively. In contrast, passive helmets are rigid and maintain a fixed shape, allowing for slower, less adjustable correction. Both types aim to prevent and treat cranial deformities in infants, catering to varying needs in pediatric care.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Cranial Molding Helmet Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plagiocephaly</li><li>Brachycephaly</li><li>Scaphocephaly</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cranial molding helmet market primarily addresses conditions like plagiocephaly, brachycephaly, and scaphocephaly, which involve abnormal head shapes in infants. Plagiocephaly is characterized by a flat spot on one side of the head, while brachycephaly results in a wider head shape due to positioned flattening. Scaphocephaly, on the other hand, involves a long, narrow head shape. These helmets help gently reshape the skull during the critical growth phase, promoting normal head development and enhancing aesthetic appearance.</p></p>
