<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three compartment Knee Prosthesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented Bone</li><li>Non-Cemented Bone</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The three-compartment knee prosthesis market is categorized into cemented and non-cemented bone types. Cemented prostheses utilize polymethylmethacrylate to bond the implant to the bone, ensuring stability and immediate load-bearing capabilities, making them common in older patients. Non-cemented prostheses rely on the natural biological fixation process, promoting bone growth into the porous surface of the implant, ideal for younger, more active patients. Both types aim to restore knee function and improve quality of life following joint damage or degeneration.</p></p>
