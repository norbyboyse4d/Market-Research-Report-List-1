<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Adhesion Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Liquid Adhesion Barrier market is categorized into absorbable and non-absorbable types. Absorbable barriers are designed to dissolve over time within the body, promoting tissue healing while reducing adhesions, making them suitable for temporary use in surgeries. Non-absorbable barriers, on the other hand, remain in the body indefinitely, providing long-term protection against adhesions but may require surgical removal later. Both types serve to improve surgical outcomes by minimizing postoperative complications related to tissue adhesion.</p></p>
