<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oral Dissolving Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oromucosal Film</li><li>Orodispersible Film</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oral dissolving film market encompasses two primary types: oromucosal films and orodispersible films. Oromucosal films are designed to dissolve in the oral cavity, delivering active ingredients directly into the bloodstream through the mucous membranes, providing rapid onset of action. In contrast, orodispersible films disintegrate upon contact with saliva, allowing the medication to disperse and be swallowed easily, which is particularly beneficial for patients with swallowing difficulties. Both types enhance patient compliance and improve therapeutic outcomes.</p></p>
