<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PV Tracking Bracket Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Axis PV Tracking Bracket</li><li>Dual Axis PV Tracking Bracket</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PV tracking bracket market consists of two primary types: single-axis and dual-axis tracking systems. Single-axis PV tracking brackets rotate on one axis to follow the sun's movement, enhancing energy capture throughout the day. In contrast, dual-axis tracking brackets can adjust on two axes, allowing for optimal sun alignment year-round. This versatility increases energy efficiency significantly, making both types popular in solar installations. The choice between them often depends on site conditions, budget, and desired energy output.</p></p>
